• Ainaa could give us a short tour of what she’s built so far, everything looks awesome btw. 
• Since Benjamin wanted to pair group perhaps we call all work on adding some routes and functionality to application, while perhaps doing a ‘spike’ on how we could approach further functionality, as well as solidify Sinatra approaches (which I believe can translate to Ruby on rails as well) If any of you ventured out to LS180 it never hurts to practice this stuff.



**Ainaa Tour**

- array of hashes ( perhaps the instructions just a txt file? )
- 'w' does it play into it in file read, can we append?
Reassurance

  save extra recipes in the session
  sql have their own id to differentiate 
  
  A- "each model is connected to a database"
    "object CamelCase, the other snake_case
  
  B-"relational database we can reference a table with chicken in it"
  
  - efficiency


**Julia**

Gems - to add quantity of different ingredients to show the shopping list

- round up by volume or common purchase options for regular consumers
- Convert US to WORLD  KG to Grams, in Asia they use grams,
- link active ingredients
- links to specific chicken parts instead of adding it up

we'll figure out as we go I guess, the benefit is the struggle in dealing with these conversions



## Goals:
- shopping list creator for multiple recipes
- weekly meal plan


### baby steps
- get a recipe saving going

Main page
• a few buttons/links for now
  - add recipe (new recipe?)

Make the main page a Navigation menu

1. add routes for adding a recipe
2. a page for editing
3. add a route for displaying the ingredients for each recipe
 A whole recipe page
 Once we are on the recipe page there is an edit button
4. displaying all the recipes


starter recipes are YAML, rest of the other recipes are in the session

Vegetarian Boolean
